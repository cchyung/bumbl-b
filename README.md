Bumbl-B is a project built by [me](https://github.com/cchyung), [@DrewParsons](https://github.com/DrewParsons), and [@markhuds](https://github.com/markhuds).

Inspired by the lovable yellow transformer, Bumblebee, who has to rely on the radio to speak, **Bumbl-B** searches a database of word-indexed audio files to tranform a sentence or phrase into a string of audio compiled of president's speeches, vines, famous interviews, and more!

Audio files were indexed using Google's [Speech to Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/).

The backend is built with [`django`](https://github.com/django/django) and [`django-rest-framework`](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework), and the frontend is built in [`angular`](https://github.com/angular/angular).
